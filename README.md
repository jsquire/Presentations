# Jesse Squire's Presentations #

### Overview ###

Included in this repository are slide decks, documents and code assets from presentations that Jesse has given at various venues, such as conferences, meet-ups, user groups, and brown bags sessions.

Included are artifacts that were either created for public release or as personal items (on personal time, using my own equipment and not intended for any employers or clients).  o my knowledge nothing contained herein is considered proprietary or confidential to any of my employers, past or present.  In the event that a former employer or client feels otherwise, please contact me and I'd be happy to discuss the disputed material.


### Structure ###

* **root**
  <br />_The root contains the overall repository configuration files, license, and general structure._

  _Each independent presentation will exist under the root in a dedicated folder, with a ReadMe file for context-sensitive information about that specific presentation._


### Licensing ###
The artifacts in this portfolio are offered under the MIT license, as described in the accompanying [license](./LICENSE "license") file.  Feel free to use the code in your own projects or the documents as templates as you see fit.  Should these works prove helpful or inspire you to iterate on them in creative ways, I find that to be a huge compliment.  We all build upon the work of those who have come before us.  In general, formal attribution is not necessary, though it is always appreciated.  I do ask, however, that you not copy an item verbatim and pass it off as your own work.
