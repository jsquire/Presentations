# Distributing Cheat Detection: #

## Applying Blockchain to Lessons Learned from Halo ##

### Description ###

For any game with a multiplayer element to it, ensuring fairness among players is a priority.  The more competitive a game is and the more desirable rewards that it offers, the more likely that it will become a target that bad actors wish to exploit.  Game developers rely on varied mechanisms, often in combination, to detect cheating.  For many of these approaches, processing typically comes at a premium, requiring a non-trivial investment in processing power.

### Abstract ###

Our goal is to allow the responsibility for cheat detection to be distributed, greatly reducing the spend on centralized processing.  In this session, we'll explore the use of Blockchain to help share the responsibility of performing cheat detection with players, focusing on being able to produce results that we trust in a reasonable amount of time, and without exposing additional avenues for cheating.  We'll begin by focusing on some lessons learned while working on Halo, then expand to include thoughts on different genres and scenarios.
